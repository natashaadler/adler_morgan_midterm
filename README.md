# Smoke-Free Policy on Campus Across Ontario 

  

Smoking outdoors on campus property has always been allowed, until recently, when many campuses in Ontario decided to take up a smoke-free policy. In this project you will see both for and against points of view.  Being students ourselves we care a great deal on this subject.  

  

## Requirements  

  

Use a modern Browser such as [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/new/) or [Chrome](https://www.google.ca/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclsrc=aw.ds&&gclid=CjwKCAjw29vsBRAuEiwA9s-0B6zIdw5_qV4ETvbcN4042nlkfk9YggWT_DI1vM4UH4vWB2I0pdWUdhoCBWoQAvD_BwE). Avoid internet explorer. You will need git installed locally as well as a good code editor such as [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com).This site is built with HTML. Javascript and CSS subfolders are added for the habit of future work flow.
