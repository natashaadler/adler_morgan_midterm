		<h3>The Pros of Policy Change</h3>
		<p>Smoking outdoors on campus property has always been allowed, until recently, when many campuses in Ontario decided to take up a smoke-free policy. Smoke-free campuses are crucial to lessening the smoking habits of young people before it damages their health. 
		
 		This policy would also prevent underage students from smoking marijuana cigarettes on campus, as well as protect the other students from second-hand smoke. There is a studied correlation between limited smoking zones on campus and a decrease in the number of students who choose to smoke, ultimately decreasing harmful smoking habits in our future generations. This change in policy is especially as unregulated e-cigarettes rise I popularity. These e-cigarettes have been traced as the source to numerous dangerous lung infections in young people and have encouraged a new generation of smokers. 

		Smoking is an addictive habit that becomes harder and harder to quit, making it essential to encourage young people to quit smoking and discourage others from beginning. As more and more post-secondary schools choose to have smoke-free campuses, students will be influenced to lead smoke-free lifestyles.</p>

		<h3>Cons of Policy Change</h3>
		Smoking outdoors on campus property has always been allowed, until recently, when many campuses in Ontario decided to take up a smoke-free policy. This policy is a violation of ones personal liberty. Students should have the choice to make for their own. This new policy change creates more anxious students, shows a lack of trust in students to make appropriate decisions, restricts students learning and belittles students opinions and values.  
		<br> <br>
		As most people entering collage/Universities across Ontario are official adults (18 years of age) we should give them to right to choose what they do with their bodies. We do not force students to go to class or stop drinking coffee, so we should not force students to stop smoking on campus. Just like we trust our students to take their learning into their own hands we should trust them to make the right decisions for themselves. Leading me to my next point, these rules are not effective. If there is a will there is a way. People will definitely find some way to smoke. As adults we have the right to make our own decision when it comes to these habits. If we ban smoking on campus it will take away the freedom of our students. It is a violation of one's personal liberty. Students who need this crutch will go against policy to smoke and usually only walk away with a slap on the wrist. 
		<br><br>
		Finally, smoking is much like drinking coffee, it is a crutch we rely on. Whether that may be for anxiety or nerves or even to keep us awake and get our brain functioning, it is something that many adolescents rely on. By banning smoking we are putting a stop to a good percentage of learning. For example students may choose to not go to class because they have anxiety and can't smoke their medicinal marijuana on campus due to the new policy. Students are now adults and should be able to make this decision for themselves. Rather policy should be in place for proper disposal of these products, so campus stays clean. By not putting to much restricton on smoking there will be less drama surrounding it. Smoking has never really been an issue in the past until it was made an issue aimlessly in recent years. Lets keep all types of students on campus to learn rather then restrict them based on their habits. 
		<br><br>
		As a good percentage of students rely on smoking, we should revisit these policies in place that violate our students personal liberty. We should not descriminate, belittle or not trust our students based on habits. If this were the case there would be no one in class. Students are adults and therefore should be able to make their own decisions.
