	<h1>Smoke Free Policy On Campus Across Ontario </h1>
	<h2>The Benefits of a Smoke-free Campus</h2>
	<section id="Emily">
		<p>Smoking outdoors on campus property has always been allowed, until recently, when many campuses in Ontario decided to take up a smoke-free policy. Smoke-free campuses are crucial to lessening the smoking habits of young people before it damages their health. 

 This policy would also prevent underage students from smoking marijuana cigarettes on campus, as well as protect the other students from second-hand smoke. There is a studied correlation between limited smoking zones on campus and a decrease in the number of students who choose to smoke, ultimately decreasing harmful smoking habits in our future generations. This change in policy is especially as unregulated e-cigarettes rise I popularity. These e-cigarettes have been traced as the source to numerous dangerous lung infections in young people and have encouraged a new generation of smokers. 

Smoking is an addictive habit that becomes harder and harder to quit, making it essential to encourage young people to quit smoking and discourage others from beginning. As more and more post-secondary schools choose to have smoke-free campuses, students will be influenced to lead smoke-free lifestyles.</p>
